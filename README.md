The Rotten Tomatoes movie review corpus in which each node in it is assigned a sentiment label ranging from 0 to 4, where the numbers represent very negative, negative, neutral, positive and very positive respectively. In this paper I use this dataset to implement a scalable and robust Convolutional Neural Network-based solution for the problem of text-based movie review multi-class sentiment analysis. The corpus consists of about 150,000 phrases is trained on a random subset of phrases (and their sub-phrases) and then evaluated on various performance metrics.
